Build hid_mapper:
=================

    cd /path/to/hid_mapper
    ./make

List recognized devices:
========================

    ./hid_mapper --list-devices

If necessary, blacklist the device in Xorg so it does not conflict with the 
mapper. Create a new file in /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/. For example
`50-remote.conf` containing:

    Section "InputClass"
    Identifier "Remote blacklist"
    MatchProduct "PHILIPS MCE USB IR Receiver- Spinel plusf0r ASUS"
    Option "Ignore" "on"
    EndSection

Capture HID events:
===================

    ./hid_mapper --learn \
                 --manufacturer 'PHILIPS' \
                 --product 'MCE USB IR Receiver- Spinel plusf0r ASUS' \
                 --map ''

This will log events recieved while pressing buttons on the remote.

As an example, pressing "OK" on the Philips MCE USB IR Receiver will
produce:

    Found HID device at /dev/hidraw0
    01 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00
    01 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

The first event (line `01 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00`) is the _key down_ event
corresponding to the pressed button.

Based on the info gathered by pressing the various buttons of your remote, and
using keys defined in `/usr/include/linux/input.h`, write (yourself!) a
map file consisting of <key code>:<key symbol> pairs:

    010000280000000000:KEY_ENTER
    030000000000020000:KEY_KP1
    030000000000040000:KEY_KP2
    030000000020000000:KEY_C
    030000000000008000:KEY_TAB

(see the maps/ directory for user contributed examples)

Run the mapper:
===============

The final step is to actually run the mapper:

    ./hid_mapper \
                 --manufacturer 'PHILIPS' \
                 --product 'MCE USB IR Receiver- Spinel plusf0r ASUS' \
                 --map 'maps/asus-spinel.map'

At this point the remote should work and emit the keys specified in the map 
file.

Since the hidraw driver is generic, this mapper should work with any HID 
receiver, even if it is not a remote. HID is used for keyboard, mouses, 
joysticks...
